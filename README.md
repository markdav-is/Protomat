# Protomat
It's like a laundromat, but you go there to prototype things.

## Origin
May 2019 there was a post about opening a [Maker Workshop](https://eugenetech.switchboardhq.com/posts/45923) in downtown Eugene.  That got about a dozen folks talking about what was missing from the local makerverse.  The ideas of a "kinkos, but for protyping" felt right.  High-end, small batch, walkable.
